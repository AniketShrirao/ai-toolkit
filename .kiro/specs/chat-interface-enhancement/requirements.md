# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing AI chat functionality by creating a comprehensive chat interface system that includes a dedicated chat page and a persistent sticky chat bubble accessible from all pages. The system will provide seamless AI interaction capabilities throughout the application while ensuring proper integration between the frontend components and existing backend API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dedicated chat page similar to the dashboard, settings, and documents pages, so that I can have focused conversations with the AI assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the chat page THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen chat interface with proper navigation integration
2. WHEN the user is on the chat page THEN the system SHALL highlight the chat navigation item in the sidebar and header
3. WHEN the user sends a message on the chat page THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing `/api/ai-chat/send` endpoint
4. WHEN the user receives a response on the chat page THEN the system SHALL display the AI response with proper formatting and timestamps
5. IF the user navigates away from the chat page THEN the system SHALL preserve the chat history for when they return

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a sticky chat bubble available on every page, so that I can quickly access AI assistance without leaving my current context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on any page THEN the system SHALL display a floating chat bubble in a fixed position
2. WHEN the user clicks the chat bubble THEN the system SHALL expand to show a compact chat interface
3. WHEN the user clicks the chat bubble header THEN the system SHALL navigate to the dedicated chat page
4. WHEN the user sends a message via the sticky chat THEN the system SHALL use the same backend API as the dedicated page
5. IF the user has unread messages THEN the system SHALL show a notification indicator on the chat bubble
6. WHEN the user minimizes the sticky chat THEN the system SHALL collapse back to the bubble state while preserving conversation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless integration between the sticky chat and dedicated chat page, so that my conversations are consistent across both interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts a conversation in the sticky chat THEN the system SHALL make the same conversation available on the dedicated chat page
2. WHEN the user continues a conversation on the dedicated page THEN the system SHALL reflect updates in the sticky chat
3. WHEN the user switches between interfaces THEN the system SHALL maintain message history and scroll position
4. IF the user has an active conversation THEN the system SHALL synchronize the state between both interfaces
5. WHEN the user clears chat history THEN the system SHALL clear it from both interfaces

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling and loading states in both chat interfaces, so that I have clear feedback about the system status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages in both interfaces
2. WHEN a message is being sent THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and disable input
3. IF a message fails to send THEN the system SHALL provide retry options and error details
4. WHEN the system is connecting to the AI service THEN the system SHALL show connection status
5. IF the user loses internet connection THEN the system SHALL queue messages and retry when connection is restored

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chat interfaces to integrate properly with the existing AI service configuration, so that users can select different AI providers and models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has configured AI settings THEN both chat interfaces SHALL use the selected provider and model
2. WHEN the user changes AI configuration THEN the system SHALL apply changes to active chat sessions
3. IF multiple AI providers are available THEN the system SHALL allow switching between them in the chat interface
4. WHEN using streaming responses THEN both interfaces SHALL handle real-time message updates
5. IF the AI service requires authentication THEN the system SHALL handle authentication seamlessly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want responsive design in both chat interfaces, so that I can use them effectively on different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses chat on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface for touch interaction
2. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the sticky chat SHALL adjust its position and size appropriately
3. IF the user is on a small screen THEN the dedicated chat page SHALL optimize layout for mobile viewing
4. WHEN the user rotates their device THEN both interfaces SHALL maintain usability and proper layout
5. IF the viewport is very small THEN the sticky chat SHALL provide a minimal but functional interface
