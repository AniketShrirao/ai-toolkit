# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the existing AI toolkit from a basic document processing system into a comprehensive, local-first AI toolkit with Ollama integration. The enhancement will add intelligent document analysis, requirement extraction, project estimation, and workflow automation capabilities while maintaining complete data privacy and eliminating cloud AI service dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Local AI Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Ollama with my AI toolkit, so that I can perform AI operations locally without relying on expensive cloud services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically detect and connect to a running Ollama instance
2. IF Ollama is not running THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for installation and setup
3. WHEN a user requests model information THEN the system SHALL display available local models and their capabilities
4. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL use local Ollama models for all AI operations
5. IF a required model is not available THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to download it through Ollama

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Document Processing

**User Story:** As a business consultant, I want intelligent document analysis capabilities, so that I can automatically extract requirements, key points, and actionable items from client documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text, identify document structure, and categorize content types
2. WHEN processing business documents THEN the system SHALL automatically identify and extract project requirements
3. WHEN analyzing requirements THEN the system SHALL categorize them as functional or non-functional requirements
4. WHEN document processing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate structured summaries with key points and action items
5. WHEN multiple documents are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain context across documents for comprehensive analysis

### Requirement 3: Project Estimation Engine

**User Story:** As a freelance developer, I want automated project estimation based on extracted requirements, so that I can quickly provide accurate quotes to clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements are extracted from documents THEN the system SHALL analyze complexity and scope
2. WHEN generating estimates THEN the system SHALL consider historical data and industry standards
3. WHEN estimation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide time estimates, resource requirements, and risk factors
4. WHEN estimates are generated THEN the system SHALL allow customization of hourly rates and complexity multipliers
5. IF insufficient data exists THEN the system SHALL request additional context or use conservative estimates

### Requirement 4: Communication Generation

**User Story:** As a consultant, I want automated email and proposal generation, so that I can quickly create professional communications based on project analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate professional email templates
2. WHEN creating proposals THEN the system SHALL include extracted requirements, estimates, and project scope
3. WHEN generating communications THEN the system SHALL maintain professional tone and include relevant technical details
4. WHEN templates are created THEN the system SHALL allow customization and personalization
5. WHEN multiple communication types are needed THEN the system SHALL provide options for emails, proposals, and status reports

### Requirement 5: Codebase Analysis Integration

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to analyze entire codebases for context-aware assistance, so that I can understand project architecture and generate relevant documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a codebase is provided THEN the system SHALL analyze folder structure, dependencies, and code patterns
2. WHEN analyzing code THEN the system SHALL identify architecture patterns, potential issues, and improvement opportunities
3. WHEN documentation is requested THEN the system SHALL generate technical documentation based on code analysis
4. WHEN integration points are analyzed THEN the system SHALL map dependencies and suggest optimization strategies
5. IF security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight them with severity levels and recommendations

### Requirement 6: Workflow Automation Framework

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want automated workflows for document processing, so that I can handle multiple client projects efficiently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded to watched folders THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger appropriate processing workflows
2. WHEN workflows are defined THEN the system SHALL support chaining multiple AI operations together
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically save results in organized folder structures
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log issues and provide recovery options
5. WHEN batch processing is needed THEN the system SHALL handle multiple documents concurrently with progress tracking

### Requirement 7: Web Dashboard Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a web-based dashboard to manage and monitor AI toolkit operations, so that I can easily track processing status and access results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current processing status and recent activities
2. WHEN managing documents THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop upload with progress indicators
3. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL organize outputs by project and document type
4. WHEN configuring settings THEN the system SHALL allow model selection, processing preferences, and workflow customization
5. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL display Ollama status, model availability, and resource usage

### Requirement 8: Data Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a consultant handling sensitive client data, I want complete local processing with no external data transmission, so that I can maintain client confidentiality and comply with data protection requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing any document THEN the system SHALL ensure all data remains on the local machine
2. WHEN AI operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use only local Ollama models without external API calls
3. WHEN storing results THEN the system SHALL organize data in secure local directories with appropriate permissions
4. WHEN system logs are created THEN the system SHALL avoid logging sensitive document content
5. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue operating normally with all local features available
