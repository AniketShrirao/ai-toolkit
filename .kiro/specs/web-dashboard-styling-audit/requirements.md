# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The web-dashboard styling has been affected by the recent file reorganization and cleanup process. While SCSS files exist for most components, they contain function call syntax errors, incorrect variable references, and inconsistent usage of the ui-styles design system. The components are using functions like `space()`, `font-size()`, `radius()`, and `shadow()` that are globally available through Vite configuration, but some function calls are incorrect (e.g., `easing()` instead of `ease()`). This feature aims to systematically fix these styling issues, ensure proper function usage, and restore consistent visual appearance across all components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the web-dashboard, I want all UI components to have proper styling with consistent spacing, typography, and colors, so that the interface looks professional and is easy to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any component in the web-dashboard THEN it SHALL have proper SCSS styling with correct function calls
2. WHEN SCSS functions are used THEN they SHALL use the correct syntax (e.g., `ease()` not `easing()`, `space()` not `spacing()`)
3. WHEN viewing text elements THEN they SHALL use the correct typography scale from ui-styles via `font-size()` function
4. WHEN viewing spacing between elements THEN it SHALL use `space()` and `task-space()` functions consistently
5. WHEN viewing colors THEN they SHALL use CSS custom properties defined in main.scss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want all components to be responsive and adapt properly to different screen sizes, so that I can use the dashboard effectively on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing components on mobile devices THEN they SHALL adapt their layout appropriately
2. WHEN viewing components on tablet devices THEN they SHALL utilize screen space effectively
3. WHEN viewing components on desktop devices THEN they SHALL display with proper spacing and proportions
4. WHEN resizing the browser window THEN components SHALL respond smoothly to size changes
5. WHEN using touch devices THEN interactive elements SHALL have appropriate touch targets

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want all components to use the ui-styles design system consistently, so that styling is maintainable and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining component SCSS files THEN they SHALL use globally available ui-styles functions via Vite config
2. WHEN using colors THEN they SHALL reference CSS custom properties defined in main.scss (e.g., `var(--primary)`, `var(--text-primary)`)
3. WHEN using spacing THEN they SHALL use `space()` and `task-space()` functions with correct parameters
4. WHEN using typography THEN they SHALL use `font-size()` function and `$font-family-base`, `$font-weight-*` variables
5. WHEN using interactive states THEN they SHALL use `shadow()`, `radius()`, and `transition()` functions correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with form elements and buttons, I want them to have proper styling and interactive states, so that I can clearly understand their functionality and status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing buttons THEN they SHALL have proper styling with hover, focus, and active states
2. WHEN viewing form inputs THEN they SHALL have consistent styling with proper focus indicators
3. WHEN viewing interactive elements THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback
4. WHEN elements are disabled THEN they SHALL have appropriate disabled styling
5. WHEN form validation occurs THEN error and success states SHALL be clearly visible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user viewing content in cards, modals, and containers, I want them to have proper visual hierarchy and spacing, so that information is well-organized and easy to scan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing cards THEN they SHALL have proper shadows, borders, and internal spacing
2. WHEN viewing modal dialogs THEN they SHALL have appropriate backdrop and container styling
3. WHEN viewing content sections THEN they SHALL have clear visual separation and hierarchy
4. WHEN viewing lists and tables THEN they SHALL have proper row spacing and alignment
5. WHEN viewing nested content THEN spacing SHALL create clear visual relationships
