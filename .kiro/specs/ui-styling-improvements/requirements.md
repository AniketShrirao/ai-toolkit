# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Toolkit web dashboard currently has several UI/UX issues that negatively impact usability and accessibility. Users are experiencing poor color contrast making text difficult to read, excessive spacing between layout components creating a disjointed experience, and inconsistent styling across different components. This feature aims to improve the overall visual design, accessibility, and user experience of the web dashboard.
