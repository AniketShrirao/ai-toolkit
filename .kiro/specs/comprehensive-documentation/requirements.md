# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create comprehensive, user-friendly documentation for the AI Toolkit application, inspired by the React documentation structure. The documentation will serve as the primary resource for developers, system administrators, and end-users to understand, implement, and effectively use the AI Toolkit's features. The documentation will be structured to provide clear learning paths from basic concepts to advanced usage, with practical examples and interactive elements.
