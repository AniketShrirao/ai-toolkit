# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Toolkit web dashboard needs a modern UI design overhaul to implement contemporary design patterns and visual enhancements based on the specific design references provided in the `docs/resources/ui-design-ideas/` folder. This feature aims to transform the current dashboard to match the layouts and visual styles shown in the reference images: app_bar_interface_1.png, app_bar_interface_2.png, app_bar_interface_3.png, card_interface.png, chat_interface.png, and dashboard-interface.png. The goal is to recreate similar visual aesthetics, layouts, and design patterns as demonstrated in these reference images.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the AI Toolkit dashboard, I want an app bar interface that matches the design patterns shown in the reference images (app_bar_interface_1.png, app_bar_interface_2.png, app_bar_interface_3.png), so that I can have a navigation experience consistent with modern design standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the app bar THEN it SHALL replicate the visual layout, typography, and styling patterns shown in the app bar reference images
2. WHEN interacting with navigation elements THEN they SHALL provide the same hover effects and visual feedback as demonstrated in the reference designs
3. WHEN viewing the app bar on different screen sizes THEN it SHALL maintain the responsive behavior and visual hierarchy shown in the reference images
4. WHEN using the app bar THEN it SHALL include the same iconography style, spacing, and color schemes as the reference designs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing dashboard content, I want card interfaces that replicate the design shown in card_interface.png, so that information is presented with the same visual appeal and organization as the reference design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing cards THEN they SHALL match the exact visual styling including shadows, borders, corners, and layout shown in card_interface.png
2. WHEN interacting with cards THEN they SHALL provide the same hover animations and visual feedback as demonstrated in the reference design
3. WHEN viewing card content THEN it SHALL follow the same typography hierarchy, spacing, and content organization as the reference image
4. WHEN cards contain different types of content THEN they SHALL maintain the same styling patterns and visual consistency shown in the reference design

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user interacting with chat features, I want a chat interface that matches the design shown in chat_interface.png, so that communication features have the same visual appeal and functionality as the reference design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing chat interfaces THEN they SHALL replicate the exact layout, message bubble styling, and visual patterns shown in chat_interface.png
2. WHEN sending or receiving messages THEN the interface SHALL provide the same animations and visual feedback as demonstrated in the reference design
3. WHEN viewing chat history THEN messages SHALL be displayed with the same spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy as the reference image
4. WHEN using chat input features THEN the interface SHALL match the input design, button styling, and interaction patterns shown in the reference

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user navigating the dashboard, I want the overall dashboard interface to match the design shown in dashboard-interface.png, so that the entire application has the same visual appeal and layout as the reference design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN it SHALL replicate the exact layout, component arrangement, and visual hierarchy shown in dashboard-interface.png
2. WHEN navigating between sections THEN the interface SHALL maintain the same styling patterns and transitions as demonstrated in the reference design
3. WHEN viewing data visualizations THEN they SHALL match the chart designs, color schemes, and visual presentation shown in the reference image
4. WHEN using dashboard features THEN all interactive elements SHALL follow the same design patterns and visual feedback as the reference design

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user accessing the dashboard, I want typography and visual hierarchy that matches the reference images, so that content has the same readability and visual appeal as the design references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing text content THEN it SHALL use the same font families, weights, and sizes as shown in all reference images
2. WHEN scanning information THEN the visual hierarchy SHALL match the heading structures and text organization shown in the reference designs
3. WHEN reading content THEN typography SHALL replicate the line heights, spacing, and text styling from the reference images
4. WHEN viewing headings and labels THEN they SHALL use the exact same typography patterns and styling as demonstrated in the references

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the interface, I want color schemes and visual effects that exactly match the reference images, so that the dashboard has the same visual appeal and aesthetic as the design references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the interface THEN it SHALL use the exact color palettes, gradients, and color combinations shown in all reference images
2. WHEN interacting with elements THEN they SHALL provide the same visual effects including shadows, borders, and hover states as the reference designs
3. WHEN viewing different interface states THEN they SHALL use the same color variations and transitions demonstrated in the reference images
4. WHEN using the dashboard THEN the overall color scheme SHALL replicate the cohesive visual experience shown across all reference designs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user on various devices, I want the reference design patterns to work seamlessly across all screen sizes, so that the visual experience matches the reference images regardless of device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the design SHALL adapt the reference patterns appropriately while maintaining the same visual hierarchy and styling
2. WHEN using tablets THEN the interface SHALL scale the reference designs effectively while preserving the same visual relationships and proportions
3. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the design SHALL match the reference images exactly in terms of layout, spacing, and visual presentation
4. WHEN switching between devices THEN the design SHALL maintain the same visual language and styling patterns shown in the reference images
