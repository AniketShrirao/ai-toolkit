# AI Toolkit Development Prompt

## Project Vision

Create a comprehensive, local-first AI toolkit that serves as a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution for document processing, workflow automation, and development assistance. This toolkit should eliminate dependency on expensive cloud AI services while maintaining professional-grade capabilities.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Local-First Architecture

- **Ollama Integration**: Leverage local LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, CodeLlama, etc.) for all AI operations
- **Zero Cloud Dependency**: All processing happens locally for maximum security and privacy
- **Client Data Security**: Safe for handling sensitive client information without data leaving the premises
- **Cost Optimization**: One-time model purchase/setup with unlimited usage

### 2. Document Processing Engine

- **PDF Processing**: Extract, summarize, and analyze PDF documents
- **Multi-format Support**: Handle various document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Pull key information, requirements, and actionable items
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple documents simultaneously

### 3. Business Automation Features

- **Requirement Gathering**: Automatically extract and structure project requirements from documents
- **Estimation Generation**: Create project estimates based on requirements and historical data
- **Email Generation**: Draft professional emails, proposals, and communications
- **Report Summarization**: Generate executive summaries and technical briefs

### 4. Developer Integration

- **Codebase Context**: Link and analyze entire codebases for context-aware assistance
- **Folder Structure Analysis**: Understand project architecture and suggest improvements
- **GitHub Integration**: Pull repositories for analysis and documentation generation
- **Code Documentation**: Auto-generate technical documentation and API specs

### 5. Workflow Automation (n8n Integration)

- **Trigger-based Processing**: Automatic document processing on file upload/creation
- **Multi-step Workflows**: Chain multiple AI operations together
- **External Integrations**: Connect with existing tools and services
- **Scheduled Operations**: Run periodic analysis and reporting tasks

## Technical Architecture

### Core Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express/Fastify
- **Frontend**: React-based dashboard for management and monitoring
- **AI Engine**: Ollama with multiple model support
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL for metadata and results storage
- **Queue System**: Bull/BullMQ for job processing
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with organized structure
