# Sass Build System Setup Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Install Sass dependencies and configure build process
- **sass**: ^1.89.2 - Main Sass compiler
- **autoprefixer**: ^10.4.21 - CSS vendor prefixing
- **postcss**: ^8.5.6 - CSS post-processing

### ✅ 2. Create Sass file structure with partials
Created organized Sass architecture in `src/styles/`:

- **`_variables.scss`**: Global variables, font families, sizes, border radius, shadows, z-index, transitions
- **`_colors.scss`**: Comprehensive color system with WCAG 2.1 AA compliant contrast ratios
- **`_spacing.scss`**: Consistent 4px-based spacing system with responsive adjustments
- **`_mixins.scss`**: Reusable mixins for buttons, cards, forms, layout, typography, and accessibility

### ✅ 3. Set up main.scss file to import all partials
- **`main.scss`**: Main entry point that imports all partials in correct order
- Includes base styles, utility classes, and responsive utilities
- Provides comprehensive utility class system similar to Tailwind CSS

### ✅ 4. Configure autoprefixer and CSS optimization
- **`postcss.config.js`**: PostCSS configuration with autoprefixer
- **`vite.config.ts`**: Updated with Sass preprocessing and CSS optimization
- Added CSS code splitting and optimized asset naming
- Configured Sass with global imports for all partials

### ✅ 5. Update main application entry point
- Updated `main.tsx` to import `main.scss` instead of `index.css`
- Added `@styles` alias to Vite configuration for easier imports

## Key Features Implemented

### Color System
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color palette (4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio)
- Semantic color assignments (primary, secondary, success, warning, error, info)
- CSS custom properties for runtime theming
- High contrast mode support

### Spacing System
- Consistent 4px-based spacing scale
- Responsive spacing adjustments for different screen sizes
- Layout-specific constants (header height, sidebar width, etc.)
- Utility classes for common spacing patterns

### Mixins and Functions
- Button variants and sizes
- Card styling patterns
- Form input styling
- Typography utilities
- Layout helpers (flexbox, grid, containers)
- Accessibility utilities (focus rings, screen reader support)
- Animation keyframes and utilities

### Build Optimization
- Sass compilation with source maps
- CSS autoprefixing for browser compatibility
- CSS code splitting for better performance
- Optimized asset naming and organization

## Verification
- ✅ Build process works correctly (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Sass compilation successful with proper CSS output
- ✅ All partials import correctly
- ✅ CSS custom properties generated properly
- ✅ Utility classes available for use

## Next Steps
The Sass build system is now ready for use in component styling. Components can:
1. Import individual partials as needed: `@use 'styles/mixins' as *;`
2. Use utility classes from the main stylesheet
3. Access color and spacing functions in component SCSS files
4. Leverage mixins for consistent styling patterns

## Requirements Satisfied
- **1.1**: Enhanced color system with proper contrast ratios ✅
- **2.1**: Consistent spacing system implementation ✅  
- **3.1**: Cohesive color scheme and visual hierarchy foundation ✅
