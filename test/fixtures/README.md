# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test data and fixtures used by the test suite.

## Structure

- `documents/` - Sample documents for testing document processing
- `codebases/` - Sample code repositories for testing codebase analysis
- `workflows/` - Sample workflow definitions for testing automation
- `expected-outputs/` - Expected results for validation
- `performance/` - Large datasets for performance testing

## Usage

Test fixtures are automatically generated by the `TestDataManager` when tests are run. The data includes:

### Documents
- Simple requirements documents
- Complex project specifications
- Technical documentation
- Business proposals
- Meeting notes
- User stories
- API documentation
- Large documents for performance testing

### Codebases
- Simple API projects
- Complex microservices architectures
- Frontend applications
- Legacy systems
- Monorepo structures

### Workflows
- Document processing workflows
- Project analysis workflows
- Batch processing scenarios
- Error recovery scenarios
- Performance-intensive workflows

## Customization

You can add custom test data by:

1. Adding files directly to the appropriate subdirectory
2. Extending the `TestDataManager` class to generate additional data types
3. Creating scenario-specific generators for your use cases

## Data Generation

Test data is generated using the `faker` library to ensure:
- Realistic but non-sensitive content
- Consistent structure across test runs
- Variety in data patterns for comprehensive testing
- Scalable data generation for performance tests
